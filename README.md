# Volve Field Production Data Analysis App

## Introduction
Welcome to the **Volve Field Production Data Analysis App**! This interactive web application is designed to provide users with in-depth insights derived from the production data of the Volve oil field, an offshore oil and gas field located in the North Sea. Our app delivers a comprehensive analysis of production data, highlighting key aspects of oil, gas, and water production, well performance, and production trends over time.

## Features

### Data Overview
- Access a summary of production data, including volumes of oil, gas, and water, well identifiers, dates, and more.

### Part 1: Key Insights
- Discover crucial insights such as each well's contribution to overall production, average monthly oil production, well types (injectors vs. producers), and the most prolific wells.

### Part 2: Detailed Analysis
- Dive into individual well production profiles with time-based plots for oil, water, and gas.
- Review total oil and water production by year with the flexibility of interactive date range sliders.
- Visualize the Gas-Oil Ratio (GOR) for each well across different time periods.

### Part 3: Specific Analysis (Well 15/9-F-14)
- Concentrate on well '15/9-F-14' for a detailed analysis of its oil production.
- Employ data smoothing and curve-fitting models to discern production patterns and forecast future output.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The core programming language used for analysis.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For efficient data manipulation and numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For creating informative and interactive visualizations.
- **Streamlit**: To turn data scripts into shareable web apps.
